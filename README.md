### User Stories

In the world of cryptocurrency, the term "moon" is a popular slang term used by enthusiasts and traders. It refers to a significant and often rapid increase in the price of a cryptocurrency, resulting in substantial profits for those who hold the asset. When a cryptocurrency is said to be "mooning," it means that its value is soaring to new heights, reaching a point where the investors who believed in it early on are reaping substantial financial rewards.

## Design and Color Scheme

The MOONTUBE visual aesthetic is a reflection of the cosmic world of cryptocurrencies. I have drawn inspiration from the moon and space, infusing the platform with a celestial vibe.

### Lunar Influence
The moon, often associated with cryptocurrency price surges or "mooning," is a central theme in our design. You'll notice lunar elements throughout the platform, from the subtle crescent moon in our logo to the moonlight hues that enhance the overall experience.

### Space-Inspired
Cryptocurrency, like the vastness of space, is full of possibilities. We've harnessed this inspiration to create a design that evokes the mystery and excitement of the crypto world. You'll feel like you're embarking on a cosmic journey each time you log in.

### Sleek and Dark
The scheme is designed to be sleek, like the black canvas of outer space. The dark background provides a comfortable and immersive viewing experience, reducing eye strain during extended visits to the platform.

### Solar Flares and Lens Flares
Incorporating elements inspired by solar flares and lens flares adds dynamic energy to the design. These splashes of vivid colors represent the vibrant and ever-changing nature of the crypto market.

### 2001: A Space Odyssey Aesthetics
As a homage to the iconic film "2001: A Space Odyssey," I have included design elements that pay tribute to its visual style. The futuristic and minimalist look of the film has inspired our layout, adding a touch of sophistication to MOONTUBE.

The design and color scheme aim to make your journey through the crypto universe not only informative but also visually captivating. MOONTUBE is more than just a platform; it's an experience that immerses you in the cosmic realm of cryptocurrency.

### Automated vs Manual Testing

In the testing process of MOONTUBE, I employed a combination of automated and manual testing approaches, each serving specific purposes depending on the nature of the testing required.

**Automated Testing**:
In this straightforward test, I created a function to make sure the app's main page ('/') is working correctly. It does this by sending a request to the main page and checking the response's status code. If the status code is 200, it means everything is working as expected, and we print out the test result. 

    # Test
    def test_get_videos_route():
        response = app.test_client().get('/')
        print("Test Result:", response.status_code)
        assert response.status_code == 200

**Manual Testing**:
Manual testing plays a critical role in evaluating the user experience and ensuring that MOONTUBE meets its user stories effectively. This approach is suitable for exploring the platform in a manner that closely simulates the actual user experience. Manual testing is ideal for assessing the intuitiveness of navigation, the appeal of the design, and the overall user satisfaction. It is also used to validate complex scenarios that are difficult to automate and to ensure that the platform aligns with the established user stories.

By combining automated testing for robust functional testing and manual testing for user-centric and exploratory testing, we ensure that MOONTUBE delivers a reliable and user-friendly experience.


## Manual Tests

1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - I tested the user registration process by creating a new account with a unique username and password.
   - I logged in with the newly created account to verify that the login functionality works.
   - I also tried logging in with incorrect credentials to ensure that the system handles authentication errors properly.

2. **Video Upload**:
   - After logging in as a registered user, I tried embedding a video using the YouTube URL and checked if they were processed correctly.
   - I verified that I could add video details such as title, description, and category during the upload process.

3. **Video Playback**:
   - Navigating to the main page, I clicked on various video thumbnails to play them.
   - I made sure that the video player functioned correctly, allowing me to pause, play, adjust volume, and enter full-screen mode.
   - I checked for smooth video streaming without interruptions.

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - I used the search feature to look for specific videos by keywords or phrases.
   - I confirmed that the search results were relevant to my query and that the search functionality worked as expected.

5. **User Profile**:
   - After logging in, I visited my user profile and verified that it displayed my uploaded videos.
   - I also tried editing my profile information to ensure that the changes were saved correctly.

6. **Video Comments**:
   - While playing a video, I left comments to ensure that the comment section was functional.
   - I checked if comments were displayed correctly under the video.

7. **Category Management**:
   - As an admin, I added a new category to the system and verified that it appeared in the category list.
   - I attempted to edit or delete a category and confirmed that these actions worked without errors.

8. **User Management**:
   - As an admin, I added a new user to the system, and I verified that the new user appeared in the user list.
   - I also tried editing or deleting a user account, ensuring these actions worked as intended.

9. **Security Testing**:
   - I attempted to access pages or features I shouldn't have access to (e.g., admin functions) to ensure that access controls were properly implemented.

10. **Cross-Browser Testing**:
    - I tested the website on different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure compatibility and functionality across various platforms.

11. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
    - I accessed the website from different mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) to confirm that it was responsive and functioned well on smaller screens.

12. **Performance Testing**:
    - I observed the load times of various pages and video playback to ensure that the website performed adequately.

13. **Usability Testing**:
    - I asked a group of real users to navigate the website and provide feedback on their experience, paying attention to any usability issues, confusion, or suggestions for improvement.

These manual tests helped ensure that the website functions as expected, provides a positive user experience, and maintains security and stability.

### Unfixed Bugs

1. **Admin Portal Redirection Issue**:
    - **Description**: When logged in as an admin and within the 'All Videos' section of the admin portal, there's an issue where, after editing another user's video or exiting the page, the admin is redirected to their own profile page instead of the admin portal.
    - **Suspected Cause**: This issue may stem from the fact that both admins and regular users use the same edit video page. After editing a video, the system defaults to returning users to their own profiles, leading to the unintended redirection for admins.
    - **Attempted Fix**: Attempts were made to implement specific if statements to address this scenario, but the desired result was not achieved. The redirection issue remains unfixed.

            if "user" in session and session["user"] == "admin":
                return redirect(url_for("admin_videos"))
            else:
                return redirect(url_for("get_categories"))

2. **Video URL Preview Discrepancy**:
    - **Description**: On the 'Add Video' page, when pasting a new video URL, a preview of the video is displayed as expected. However, on the 'Edit Video' page, the existing or previously entered URL does not generate a preview.
    - **Issue Analysis**: This issue appears to be related to the functionality disparity between the 'Add Video' and 'Edit Video' pages. The 'Add Video' page successfully generates a video preview, while the 'Edit Video' page does not provide this feature for existing URLs.
    - **Unresolved State**: Despite efforts to ensure consistency in this feature, the bug remains unfixed.

    **Edit Video**:
